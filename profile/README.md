### Quickstart

[docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is the fastest way to get started. The [docker compose file](https://github.com/ledgersmb/ledgersmb-docker) will set up an installation with these commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/ledgersmb/ledgersmb-docker/blob/1.10/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

See [the docker compose installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) in case you don't already have it installed.
